excerpt: 'The present invention provides a method, device, apparatus and medium for designing measurement wiring for a multibeam measurement vessel. Among other things, the method comprises: obtaining seawater depth data of a rectangular sea area, determining seabed topography and geomorphology data based on the seawater depth data and establishing a curved surface measurement wiring model; and determining the measurement wiring of the multibeam measurement vessel based on a genetic algorithm, a Monte Carlo method and the curved surface measurement wiring model. In this approach, the establishment of the surface measurement wiring model can show good performance under various parameter settings with certain generalization ability.'
