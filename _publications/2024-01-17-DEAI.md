excerpt: 'Pricing of sailboats is a topic that many extreme sports enthusiasts like to pay attention to. For the sailboat market, price prediction is crucial and is a key factor in making decisions such as marketing strategies, cost calculation, and profit calculation. By using regression models and machine learning, companies can better grasp market risks, improve product pricing accuracy, and increase their profitability. In addition, this method is very valuable in various industries such as e-commerce, retail, finance, and real estate. This paper aims to establish the relationship between sailboat prices and various factors using typical models based on statistical methods and machine learning, and explore the regional and sailboat type effects on prices, particularly the regional effects of specific areas such as Hong Kong (SAR). By comparing the accuracy of each model, we can obtain some insights into the above issues.'
