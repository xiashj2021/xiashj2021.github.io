excerpt: 'The present invention provides a method, apparatus, electronic device and storage medium for processing a mathematical model, comprising: establishing a first mathematical model of the coverage width of the multibeam bathymetry and the overlap rate between adjacent strips of the corresponding seabed topographic data based on the opening angle of the multibeam transducer, the slope of the slope and the depth of the sea water at the center of the sea area; establishing a second mathematical model of the coverage width of the multibeam bathymetry based on the angle of the direction of the survey line to the normal of the slope of the seabed projected onto the horizontal plane, the angle between the multibeam The second mathematical model of the coverage width of multibeam bathymetry is established based on the angle between the measurement line direction and the projection of the normal direction of the seabed slope on the horizontal plane, the opening angle of the multibeam transducer, the slope of the seabed slope and the depth of the seawater at the center of the sea area; and the measurement cabling of the multibeam survey vessel is determined based on the first and second mathematical models. Based on the parameters of seabed slope, seawater depth and acoustic wave propagation speed, mathematical expressions between the coverage width of multibeam bathymetry and the overlap rate of adjacent strips and these parameters are derived to optimize the completion of the survey line design more accurately.'
