excerpt: 'The objective of this paper is to enhance the precision and efficacy of seabed topographic surveying through the utilisation of multibeam bathymetry technology in intricate marine environments. The study adopts a combination of mathematical geometric derivation and genetic algorithm to construct a mathematical relationship model between the coverage width of multibeam bathymetry and the overlap rate of the coverage width of neighbouring lines under different seabed terrain conditions, and then introduces Monte Carlo to assist in the establishment of a more efficient model, so as to achieve the optimization of the design of survey line trajectories under the two-dimensional static and three-dimensional dynamic environments. The results show that the line design based on genetic algorithm can significantly improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the bathymetric data acquisition, optimise the line trajectory, and provide mathematical support for the practical application of the multibeam line survey problem.'
