excerpt: 'As the world pays more attention to mental health issues, depression has become one of the leading psychiatric disorders affecting quality of life. Traditional clinical diagnoses rely on subjective interviews and scale assessments, which are time-consuming and costly. They are also susceptible to subjective bias, resulting in delayed diagnoses for a large number of potential cases. In recent years, natural language processing and machine learning technology have made significant breakthroughs, and depression recognition based on text data has gradually become a research hotspot. Human language, as a carrier of psychological state, often contains traces of depressive mood in features such as vocabulary selection, grammatical structure, and emotional tendency. By analyzing textual data, such as social media posts, clinical interview transcripts, and personal writings, researchers have attempted to develop objective, quantifiable models for detecting depression. However, current literature excessively focuses on improving the performance of classification models and generally ignores factors affecting depression recognition. Additionally, the severe lack of clinically validated, open-source Chinese datasets hinders depression recognition research in the Chinese domain. To explore the intrinsic mapping of semantic units and data labels in the Chinese depression recognition task, this thesis studied the key factors influencing depression recognition based on interview text data modeling.

(1) To avoid privacy issues and the consumption of resources associated with repetitive medical data collection, this thesis used standardized clinical interview recordings collected by the Ubiquitous Awareness and Intelligent Solutions Laboratory at Lanzhou University from partner hospitals. The thesis then constructed a Chinese interview text dataset, DepInter-CN, through professional speech recognition transcription and manual annotation. After statistical analysis, the thesis found that the dataset is balanced and that the text length is mainly concentrated within 150 words. This provided a reference for future experiments.

(2) To determine an effective method among many text feature construction methods, build a high-performance model, and further explore the correlation between interview questions and depression recognition, this thesis discussed the influence of control variables at three levels: feature engineering, model architecture, and data selection. Prior to this study, baseline variables for subsequent experiments were screened by selecting classical feature construction sets and classification models. Considering that other factors not discussed in this thesis may interact with the three aforementioned factors, the independent variables with significantly poorer performance were excluded using the exclusion induction method. Finally, a hybrid recognition architecture, DepHybrid, was proposed. DepHybrid integrates a pre-trained language model, machine learning, and deep learning, achieving an accuracy rate of 77% and an F1 score, outperforming other architectures.

(3) To explore multi-parameter optimization in architecture and enhance performance, this thesis introduced the UBC algorithm. It achieved automatic hyper-parameter optimization by abstracting the problem as a multi-armed slot machine, improving accuracy by 0.23%, recall by 10.3%, and AUC by 4.5% compared to the original.

(4) To improve transparency in the use of AI technology in healthcare, this thesis used t-SNE and SHAP methods to validate the credibility of the model architecture in terms of macroscopic and microscopic feature spaces, respectively.'
