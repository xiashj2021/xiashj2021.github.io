excerpt: 'Movie reviews have always been a popular and enduring subject of interest among researchers. Sentiment analysis plays a significant role in this domain. The utilization of machine learning and natural language processing techniques can provide valuable insights into the emotional responses of audiences towards movies, as well as facilitate the appraisal of their reputation and market potential. This is achieved through the analysis of sentiment expressed in movie reviews. Furthermore, this approach is highly valuable in various application domains such as data mining, web mining, and social media analysis. This paper aims to conduct a comparative analysis by utilizing typical models based on machine learning and neural networks, along with the integration of natural language processing techniques. The IMDB database, which contains 50,000 reviews, will be used, and data preprocessing will be performed before applying these models. By comparing the accuracy of each model, insights regarding movie reviews can be derived.'
